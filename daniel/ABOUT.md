## Homework 1

[Dataset](http://ai.stanford.edu/~amaas/data/sentiment/)

This is a movie review dataset used in [this paper](http://ai.stanford.edu/~amaas/papers/wvSent_acl2011.pdf) for sentiment analysis

I will attempt to train and test a simple binary classifier for positive or negative sentiment with this data.
